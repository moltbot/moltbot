# Clawdbot on Oracle Cloud (OCI)

## Goal

Run a persistent Clawdbot Gateway on Oracle Cloud's **Always Free** ARM tier — **$0/month forever** with more resources than most paid VPS options.

## Cost Comparison (2026)

| Provider | Plan | Specs | Price/mo | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|----------|-------|
| **Oracle Cloud** | Always Free ARM | 4 OCPU, 24GB RAM | **$0** | Best value, this guide |
| **Hetzner** | CX22 | 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM | €3.79 (~$4) | Cheapest paid, EU datacenters |
| **DigitalOcean** | Basic | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM | $6 | Easy UI, good docs |
| **Vultr** | Cloud Compute | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM | $6 | Many locations |
| **Linode** | Nanode | 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM | $5 | Now part of Akamai |

**Why Oracle?** The Always Free tier gives you 4x the CPU and 24x the RAM of a $6 DigitalOcean droplet — for $0. The tradeoff is ARM architecture (most things work) and Oracle's signup process (can be finicky).

## Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud account ([signup](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/))
- Tailscale account (free at [tailscale.com](https://tailscale.com))
- ~30 minutes

## 1) Create an OCI Instance

1. Log into [Oracle Cloud Console](https://cloud.oracle.com/)
2. Navigate to **Compute → Instances → Create Instance**
3. Configure:
   - **Name:** `clawdbot`
   - **Image:** Ubuntu 24.04 (aarch64)
   - **Shape:** `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` (Ampere ARM)
   - **OCPUs:** 2 (or up to 4)
   - **Memory:** 12 GB (or up to 24 GB)
   - **Boot volume:** 50 GB (up to 200 GB free)
   - **SSH key:** Add your public key
4. Click **Create**
5. Note the public IP address

**Tip:** If instance creation fails with "Out of capacity", try a different availability domain or retry later. Free tier capacity is limited.

## 2) Configure VCN Security (Critical)

OCI's Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) acts as a firewall at the network edge — traffic is blocked before it reaches your instance. This is more secure than host-based firewalls.

1. Go to **Networking → Virtual Cloud Networks**
2. Click your VCN → **Security Lists** → Default Security List
3. **Remove** all ingress rules except:
   - `0.0.0.0/0 UDP 41641` (Tailscale)
4. Keep default egress rules (allow all outbound)

This blocks everything except Tailscale. You'll SSH via Tailscale, not the public IP.

## 3) Connect and Update

```bash
# Initial connection via public IP (one time only)
ssh ubuntu@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP

# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y build-essential unzip
```

**Note:** `build-essential` is required for ARM compilation of some dependencies.

## 4) Configure User and Hostname

```bash
# Set hostname
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname clawdbot

# Set password for ubuntu user
sudo passwd ubuntu

# Enable lingering (keeps user services running after logout)
sudo loginctl enable-linger ubuntu
```

## 5) Install Tailscale

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up --ssh --hostname=clawdbot
```

This enables Tailscale SSH, so you can connect via `ssh clawdbot` from any device on your tailnet — no public IP needed.

Verify:
```bash
tailscale status
```

**From now on, connect via Tailscale:** `ssh ubuntu@clawdbot` (or use the Tailscale IP).

## 6) Install Homebrew (ARM)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Add to PATH
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS=1' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Install GCC (needed for some packages on ARM)
brew install gcc
```

## 7) Install Clawdbot

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawd.bot/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

When prompted "How do you want to hatch your bot?", select **"Do this later"**.

## 8) Configure Gateway with Tailscale Serve

```bash
clawdbot config set gateway.bind loopback
clawdbot config set gateway.tailscale.mode serve
clawdbot config set gateway.trustedProxies '["127.0.0.1"]'
clawdbot config set gateway.auth.allowTailscale true
clawdbot config set gateway.controlUi.allowInsecureAuth true
systemctl --user restart clawdbot-gateway
```

This configures:
- Gateway binds to loopback only (127.0.0.1)
- Tailscale Serve provides HTTPS and handles external routing
- Authentication via Tailscale identity headers (no tokens needed)

## 9) Verify

```bash
# Check version
clawdbot --version

# Check daemon status
systemctl --user status clawdbot-gateway

# Check Tailscale Serve
tailscale serve status

# Test local response
curl http://localhost:18789
```

---

## Access the Control UI

From any device on your Tailscale network:

```
https://clawdbot.<tailnet-name>.ts.net/
```

Replace `<tailnet-name>` with your tailnet name (visible in `tailscale status`).

No SSH tunnel needed. Tailscale provides:
- HTTPS encryption (automatic certs)
- Authentication via Tailscale identity
- Access from any device on your tailnet (laptop, phone, etc.)

## Security: Why VCN + Tailscale Is Enough

With the VCN configured as above (only UDP 41641 open), you have **defense in depth** that makes traditional VPS hardening redundant.

**How it works:** The VCN blocks traffic at the network edge — before it reaches your instance. Combined with Tailscale SSH (which bypasses sshd entirely), there's no attack surface for typical threats.

### What's Already Protected

| Traditional Step | Needed? | Why |
|------------------|---------|-----|
| UFW firewall | No | VCN blocks before traffic reaches instance |
| fail2ban | No | No brute force if port 22 blocked at VCN |
| sshd hardening | No | Tailscale SSH doesn't use sshd |
| Disable root login | No | Tailscale uses Tailscale identity, not system users |
| SSH key-only auth | No | Tailscale authenticates via your tailnet |
| Disable IPv6 | No | OCI free tier doesn't assign public IPv6 |

### Still Recommended

- **Credential permissions:** `chmod 700 ~/.clawdbot`
- **Security audit:** `clawdbot security audit`
- **System updates:** `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` regularly
- **Monitor Tailscale:** Review devices in [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin)

### Verify Security Posture

```bash
# Confirm no public ports listening
sudo ss -tlnp | grep -v '127.0.0.1\|::1'

# Verify Tailscale SSH is active
tailscale status | grep -q 'offers: ssh' && echo "Tailscale SSH active"

# Optional: disable sshd entirely
sudo systemctl disable --now ssh
```

---

## Fallback: SSH Tunnel

If Tailscale Serve isn't working, use an SSH tunnel:

```bash
# From your local machine (via Tailscale)
ssh -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 ubuntu@clawdbot
```

Then open `http://localhost:18789`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Instance creation fails ("Out of capacity")
Free tier ARM instances are popular. Try:
- Different availability domain
- Retry during off-peak hours (early morning)
- Use the "Always Free" filter when selecting shape

### Tailscale won't connect
```bash
# Check status
sudo tailscale status

# Re-authenticate
sudo tailscale up --ssh --hostname=clawdbot --reset
```

### Gateway won't start
```bash
clawdbot gateway status
clawdbot doctor --non-interactive
journalctl --user -u clawdbot-gateway -n 50
```

### Can't reach Control UI
```bash
# Verify Tailscale Serve is running
tailscale serve status

# Check gateway is listening
curl http://localhost:18789

# Restart if needed
systemctl --user restart clawdbot-gateway
```

### ARM binary issues
Some tools may not have ARM builds. Check:
```bash
uname -m  # Should show aarch64
```

Most npm packages work fine. For binaries, look for `linux-arm64` or `aarch64` releases.

---

## Persistence

All state lives in:
- `~/.clawdbot/` — config, credentials, session data
- `~/clawd/` — workspace (SOUL.md, memory, artifacts)

Back up periodically:
```bash
tar -czvf clawdbot-backup.tar.gz ~/.clawdbot ~/clawd
```
